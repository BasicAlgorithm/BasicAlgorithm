## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am BasicAlgorithm.\
I am a ignorant about too many things but I am a little less about industrial engineering, cognitive science and computer science.\
\
ðŸ”­  I am focus on find out The First, I think it will be short and really basic, Algorithm.\
ðŸ‘¯  I am looking to collaborate/work/practice on any brain/biology lab.\
ðŸŒ±  I am currently studying CS^2. cognitive science/computer science.

## My main work

- The First Algorithm. TFA

## My Hypothesis:

| Area | Hypothesis | Year |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Cognitive + Process Mining | With action potential logs, as information systems logs, we would have new insights about mental processes and maybe mental contents. | 2022 |
| Survival Analysis + Education | Resilience is all you need. | 2022 |
| AGI | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will be brought by Cognitive Science with a bit of Computer Science.  | 2022 |
| Happiness | Levels of oxytocin indicate your level of happiness if you decided for professional success and not family. | 2022 |
| End of world | When We discover how our brain work exactly, on the same time, We know the grand date. | 2021 |
| Education | The mediocre teacher, says and/or show a lot of things. The average teacher, explains fearfully and expect you think like him. The good teacher, demonstrates and bring you to your zone of proximal development. The great teacher, inspires you and you want to become like him. (William Ward improvement) | 2021 |
| Investment | Food. | 2021 |
| Love | Love is an emotional expression that depend of emotional experience of like (not want) to be next to someone. | 2021 |
| Education | The main problem with education is that pseudo teachers do not accept their deep ignorance about education and more sad, think that education is about saying concepts when it is about inspiration and art. | 2021 |
| Education | If an educational institution has not a clear definition about how the world will be on 5-10 years. It should be close.| 2020 |
| Neuroscience | Whoever discovers how the brain works exactly, had discovered the second atomic bomb. | 2020 |
| How universe work | not biological technology => biological techonology (humans) => not biological technology => ...| 2018|
| Business | Most profitable business are religions and educational institutions.| 2017 |
| God | Just one and above all we know. Religions are very far from this concept. | 2010 |


We are in the most important century of all of time. \
