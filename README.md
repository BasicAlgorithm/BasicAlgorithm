## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am BasicAlgorithm.\
I am a ignorant about too many things but I am a little less about engineering, cognitive science and computer science.\
\
ðŸ”­  I am seriously learning/working on find out The First, I think it will be short and really basic, Algorithm.\
ðŸ‘¯  I am looking to collaborate/work/practice on any brain/biology lab.\
ðŸŒ±  I am currently studying CS^2. cognitive science/computer science.

## My main work

- The First -the life- Algorithm. TFA

## My Hypothesis:

| Area | Hypothesis | Year |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| End of world | When We discover how our brain work exactly, on the same time, We know the grand date. | 2021 |
| Education | If an educational institution has not a clear definition about how the world will be on 5-10 years. It should be close.| 2020 |
| Human | not biological technology => biological techonology (humans) => not biological technology => ...| 2018|
| Bussiness | Most profitable are religions and educational institutions.| 2017 |
| God | Just one and above all we know. Religions are very far from this concept. | 2010 |
| Any | Love is a rational manifestation of wanting to be next to someone. | 2021 |
| Any | The main problem with education is that pseudo teachers do not accept their deep ignorance about education and more sad, think that education is about saying concepts when it is about inspiration and art. | 2021 |


## Do not forget this:
We are in the most important century of all of time. \
_Neuroscience is today like physics before Newton or Genetics before discovering DNA. "Rafael Yustre"_\
_Whoever discovers how the brain works exactly, had discovered the second atomic bomb. "BasicAlgorithm"_
