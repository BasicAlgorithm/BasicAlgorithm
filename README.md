## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am BasicAlgorithm.\
I am a ignorant about too many things but I am a little less about engineering, neuroscience and computer science.\
\
ðŸ”­  I am seriously learning/working on find out The First, I think it will be short and really basic, Algorithm.\
ðŸ‘¯  I am looking to collaborate/work/practice on any brain/biology lab.\
ðŸŒ±  I am currently studying neuroscience/computer science.\
ðŸ’¬  If you are interesting on some topic like me, contact me leaving a feedback.

## My main work

- The First Algorithm.

## My theories:

| Area | Theory | Year |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| End of world | When We discover how our brain work exactly, on the same time, We know the grand date. | 2021 |
| Education | If an educational institution has not a clear definition about how the world will be on 5-10 years. It should be close.| 2020 |
| Human | not biological technology => biological techonology (humans) => not biological technology => ...| 2018|
| Bussiness | Most profitable are religion and educational institutions.| 2017 |
| God | Just one and above all we know. Religions are very far from this concept. | 2010 |

## Do not forget this:
We are in the most important century of all of time. \
_Neuroscience is today like physics before Newton or Genetics before discovering DNA. "Rafael Yustre"_\
_Whoever discovers how the brain works exactly, had discovered the second atomic bomb. "BasicAlgorithm"_
