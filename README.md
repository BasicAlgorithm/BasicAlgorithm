## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am BasicAlgorithm.

An 1 year old unstoppable baby babbling how the algorithm of Artificial General Intelligence is.

ðŸ”­  I am focus on find out The First, I think it will be short and really basic, Algorithm.\
ðŸ‘¯  I am looking for postgraduate studies. (I already don't use diapers and my parents gave me permission)\
ðŸŒ±  I am always learning multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary things looking for transdisciplinary things.

## My main work

- The First Algorithm. TFA

## My Hypothesis:

| Area | Hypothesis | Year |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Resilience | Want to develop resilience? Train/Teach a subject to fight (neither fright nor flight) in face of stress situation. After, turn on its dopaminergic diffuse modulatory system in the beginning of that fight reaction. [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05328-2) | 2022-11 |
| People && religion | Humanity needs religion but each being human does not. | 2022-11 |
| People | There are 4 types of people: (i) people who think as rich and have money, (ii) people who think as rich and have no money, (iii) people who do not think as rich and have money, and (iv) people who do not think as rich and have no money. Distribution of this hypothesis is still under discussion. | 2022-11 |
| Parents | We can define the future of a person until before the critical period ends (i.e. more or less over early childhood). We can achieve this by incentivizing the practice of the sensorial/motor skill that we want. But not like Watson thought, if not, with an enriched environment. This applies to professions that depend mostly on sensory/motor-skill abilities. | 2022 |
| Religion | Religions are good for business not to stop. When someone that you love dies, Most often, you fall in a deep sadness. This sadness is not another thing that is our own manifestation that you can not see that person again plus you don't know exactly where she/he is now (This is genuine in the being human). But, if you know that that person is in a better place than here, happier, and you will see her/him again one day (what religions tell you and you believe with faith). You probably will get over that sadness sooner and most importantly, you will go to work sonner, right?. Then, are religions good for your soul or for business not to stop? | 2022 |
| General | Two things bring magic to reality, one is computer softwares and the other is educate. | 2022 |
| AI | Natural Language is all you need: This approach is all about transforming your entire numeric dataset into natural language to take advantage of pre-trained transformers natural language models. | 2022 |
| Cognitive + Process Mining | With action potential logs, as information systems logs, we would have new insights about mental processes and maybe mental contents. | 2022 |
| Survival Analysis + Education | Resilience is all you need. | 2022 |
| AGI | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will be brought by Cognitive Science with a bit of Computer Science.  | 2022 |
| Happiness | Levels of oxytocin indicate your level of happiness if you decided for professional success and not family. | 2022 |
| End of world | When We discover how our brain work exactly, on the same time, We know the grand date. | 2021 |
| Education | The mediocre teacher, says and/or show a lot of things. The average teacher, explains fearfully and expect you think like him. The good teacher, demonstrates and bring you to your zone of proximal development. The great teacher, inspires you and you want to become like him. (William Ward improvement) | 2021 |
| Investment | Food. | 2021 |
| Love | Love is an emotional expression that depend of emotional experience of like (not want) to be next to someone. | 2021 |
| Education | The main problem with education is that pseudo teachers do not accept their deep ignorance about education and more sad, think that education is about saying concepts when it is about inspiration and art. | 2021 |
| Education | If an educational institution has not a clear definition about how the world will be on 5-10 years. It should be close.| 2020 |
| Neuroscience | Whoever discovers how the brain works exactly, had discovered the second atomic bomb. | 2020 |
| How universe work | not biological technology => biological techonology (humans) => not biological technology => ...| 2018|
| Business | Most profitable business are religions and educational institutions.| 2017 |
| God | Just one and above all we know. Religions are very far from this concept. | 2010 |

We are in the most important century of all of time. \
