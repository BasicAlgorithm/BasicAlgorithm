# About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am BasicAlgorithm.

An 1 year old unstoppable baby babbling how the algorithm of Artificial General Intelligence is.

ðŸ”­  I am focus on find out The First, I think it will be short and really basic, Algorithm.\
ðŸ‘¯  I am looking for postgraduate studies. (I already don't use diapers and my parents gave me permission)\
ðŸŒ±  Road to transdisciplinary brain.

## My final work

- The First Algorithm. TFA

## My hypotheses

| Area | Hypothesis | Time |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Future | The equation of the future is an Open-Universe Probability model with numeric statements deeply and carefully defined in three layers: biological/biochemical, mind(mental processes and mental contents), and environment. | 2023-03 |
| God | Are our pupils a black hole? If true, are black holes in space the pupils of god? | 2023-03 |
| AGI | The model of AGI is a model capable of learning continuously, in an infinite loop of training phase that we can test anytime, anywhere and anyway. | 2022-12 |
| Development | Estrogens are not only the reason women are more beautiful than men, but also the reason for a sooner GABA/glutamate balance in women. [*mainly inspired from*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008222001563?via%3Dihub)  | 2022-11 |
| Intelligent people | The problem with people with specific or theoretical intelligence is that they don't realize their specific intelligence is not also general or practical intelligence. This argument is also the reason why intelligent people are not necessarily talented people. [*mainly inspired from*](#breakout-concepts) | 2022-11 |
| Resilience | Want to develop resilience? Train/Teach a subject to fight (neither fright nor flight) in face of stress situation. After, turn on its dopaminergic diffuse modulatory system in the beginning of that fight reaction. [*mainly inspired from*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05328-2) | 2022-10 |
| People && religion | Humanity needs religion but each being human does not. | 2022-10 |
| People | There are 4 types of people: (i) people who think as rich and have money, (ii) people who think as rich and have no money, (iii) people who do not think as rich and have money, and (iv) people who do not think as rich and have no money. Distribution of this hypothesis is still under discussion. | 2022-10 |
| Parents | We can define the future of a person until before the critical period ends (i.e. more or less over early childhood). We can achieve this by incentivizing the practice of the sensorial/motor skill that we want. But not like Watson thought, if not, with an enriched environment. This applies to professions that depend mostly on sensory/motor-skill abilities. | 2022 |
| Religion | Religions are good for business not to stop. When someone that you love dies, Most often, you fall in a deep sadness. This sadness is not another thing that is our own manifestation that you can not see that person again plus you don't know exactly where she/he is now (This is genuine in the being human). But, if you know that that person is in a better place than here, happier, and you will see her/him again one day (what religions tell you and you believe with faith). You probably will get over that sadness sooner and most importantly, you will go to work sooner, right?. Then, are religions good for your soul or for business not to stop? | 2022 |
| General | Two things bring magic to reality, one is computer softwares and the other is educate. | 2022 |
| AI | Natural Language is all you need: This approach is all about transforming your entire numeric dataset into natural language to take advantage of pre-trained transformers natural language models. | 2022 |
| Cognitive + Process Mining | With action potential logs, as information systems logs, we would have new insights about mental processes and maybe mental contents. | 2022 |
| Survival Analysis + Education | Resilience is all you need. | 2022 |
| AGI | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will be brought by Cognitive Science with a bit of Computer Science.  | 2022 |
| Happiness | Levels of oxytocin indicate your level of happiness if you decided for professional success and not family. | 2022 |
| End of world | When We discover how our brain work exactly, on the same time, We know the grand date. | 2021 |
| Education | The mediocre teacher, says and/or show a lot of things. The average teacher, explains fearfully and expect you think like him. The good teacher, demonstrates and bring you to your zone of proximal development. The great teacher, inspires you and you want to become like him. (William Ward improvement) | 2021 |
| Investment | Food. | 2021 |
| Love | Love is an emotional expression that depend of emotional experience of like (not want) to be next to someone. | 2021 |
| Education | The main problem with education is that pseudo teachers do not accept their deep ignorance about education and more sad, think that education is about saying concepts when it is about inspiration and art. | 2021 |
| Education | If an educational institution has not a clear definition about how the world will be on 5-10 years. It should be close.| 2020 |
| Neuroscience | Whoever discovers how the brain works exactly, had discovered the second atomic bomb. | 2020 |
| How universe work | not biological technology => biological technology (humans) => not biological technology => ...| 2018|
| Business | Most profitable business are religions and educational institutions.| 2017 |
| God | Just one and above all we know. Religions are very far from this concept. | 2010 |

## My notes

> You may skip this part. It is here because I don't have another place to put it that allows me to review quickly.

- **Intelligence** is **GI** + **EI**: ```adapted by me```
  - General Intelligence (**GI**) [[1]](#1) [[2]](#2): Its function is to govern the virtues of actions. In this way **GI** faces wishes, sentiment, beliefs, etc. Also, genetic, social, cultural, and economic aspects of a person. **GI** has two parts:
    - Unconscious Intelligence (**GUI**) [[3]](#3): Where sentiment, ideas, wishes, motivation, and the like, born.
    - Conscious Intelligence (**GCI**) [[4]](#4): Where resilience, focus on goals, effort, tenacity, emotions management, and the like, born.
  - Specific Intelligence (**EI**) [[5]](#5): Linguistic Intelligence, Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, Spatial Intelligence, Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence, Musical Intelligence, Interpersonal Intelligence, and Intrapersonal Intelligence. [[6]](#6)
- **Talent**,  ```adapted by me```, is a good CEO (**GI**) able to manage effectively its departments (EI) on: (i) the choosing and pursuit of goals, (ii) have the necessary information to those goals, (iii) manage emotions correctly, (iv) keep the part 2 updated, and (v) have virtues of action. [[7]](#7)
- To concerned parents for the education of their children: *The new competitive advantage for people is passion for something* by Tony Wagner.
- *What I hear â€¦ I forget. what I see â€¦ I remember. what I do â€¦ I understand.* Chinese proverb.
- Minimum requirements for XXI people: [[8]](#8)
  - Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
  - Collaboration Across Networks and Leading by Influence
  - Agility and Adaptability
  - Initiative and Entrepreneurialism
  - Effective Oral and Written Communication
  - Accessing and Analyzing Information
  - Curiosity and Imagination
- Education does not need methods or new methods. Education only needs a new attitude. by AndrÃ© Stern
- *Reward prediction errors*: predicted reward - received reward.
  - DN (dopamine neurons) more active => unexpectedly reward || bigger than expected.
  - DN depressed => less than predicted.
- *Aversive stimuli*: DN (on nucleus accumbens) learn to predict aversive events but not by *reward prediction error* but other stimuli that occurred a few seconds before an event (which effectively will produce a depressed *reward prediction error*). [[9]](#9)
- Creative cognition are: [[10]](#10) [[11]](#11)
  - Overcoming the semantic constraints of existing knowledge, which involves goal-directed behavior through cognitive control, and
  - Building unusual associations to expand the existing structure of knowledge, which involves the spontaneous and unconstrained generation of novel associations.
